## Getting to know the town

**Q1 What is the name of the protestor's relative that was the first to own land on what is now Glen Rock?**

![William Heathcote](img/Q1.png)

For this question, I could find the anwser by looking at the history of Glen Rock on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glen_Rock,_Pennsylvania).

**Q2 What is the name of the main Railroad through town?**

![Railroad](img/Q2.png)

I used the same [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glen_Rock,_Pennsylvania) page to find the anwser. If I try to search an element on the page by typing "Rail", I found the flag.

To confirm my finding, I can use google maps to make sure this is the correct railroad.

**Q3 On the side of the local library, what does the third part of the mural say?**

I could find the local library by searching on Google maps.

![Library](img/library.png)

I found the "[Arthur Hufnagel Public Library of Glen Rock](https://goo.gl/maps/m69N9PPFZXpNoNDz7?coh=178572&entry=tt)", but after trying with Street View I couldn't get a closer look on the mural painting.

![Mural](img/mural.png)

After looking in the pictures posted in the library reviews, I found a picture in front of the mural I could use.

![Mural Front](img/Q3.png)
![Mural Close](img/Q3close.png)

I could read the writing of the mural using this picture. After trying the flag "FIRST NATIONAL BANK", it doesn't work so I though that might be a typo or a case sensitive flag.

**Q4 Which female artist donated her pastel work "under the rainbow" to the library?**

I was stuck on this one because I couldn't find the pastel work. But after using Google dorking, I found a [newspaper](https://issuu.com/engleprintingandpublishing/docs/ccs_102319) talking about a library diplaying artwork. After reading the article, I was able to get the flag.
